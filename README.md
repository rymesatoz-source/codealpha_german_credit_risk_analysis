# CodeAlpha Internship - Task 1: Credit Risk Analysis

This repository contains my solution for **Code Alpha Internship - Task 1**.  
The task is focused on analyzing credit risk data, handling imbalance, and building ML models 
to classify "Good" vs "Bad" credit risk customers.

## 📌 Steps Covered
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution plots
   - Correlation analysis
   - Boxplots for outlier detection

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Missing values handling
   - Outlier removal using IQR
   - Feature engineering (Monthly_Payment, Age_Group)
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Standard Scaling of numerical features

3. **Data Split & Imbalance Handling**
   - Train-Test Split
   - SMOTE applied to balance classes

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine
   - K-Nearest Neighbors

5. **Model Comparison**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Final conclusion on best-performing model
